# General-Algorithms
General Algorithms which were proven, most are using Dynamic Planning to replace recursing for better performance

print("C(7,3) = \(Combinations(7,3))" ) // Should be 35
print("C(6,3) = \(Combinations(6,3))" ) // Should be 20
print("C(6,2) = \(Combinations(6,2))" ) // Should be 15
